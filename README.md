#SkyUI OpenSourced#
###well sort of###

Due to the original authors decision to go payware on newer versions of SkyUI, the source for version 4.1 is released here. The SWF files were decompiled using swfmill. Keep an eye on this repo, a fork is planned as soon as I learn how these files work.

I may need to find the font files and/or contact the artists behind the various icon sets (or replace with other icon sets).
